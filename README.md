## 出现频率最高的
### [1.Two Sum](./001. Two Sum/) (java)
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

### [8. String to Integer (atoi)](./008. String to Integer (atoi)/) (java)
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

### [15. 3Sum](./015. 3Sum/) (java)
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

### [020. Valid Parentheses](./020. Valid Parentheses/) (java)
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.

### [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](./021. Merge Two Sorted Lists/) (java)
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### [28. Implement strStr()](./028. Implement strStr()/) (java)
Implement strStr().
Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

### [56. Merge Intervals](./056. Merge Intervals/) (java)
Total Accepted: 69716 Total Submissions: 270310 Difficulty: Hard
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
For example,
Given `[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]`,
return [`1,6],[8,10],[15,18]`.

### [57. Insert Interval](./057.-Insert-Interval/) (java)
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary)H.
You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

### [65. Valid Number](./065.-Valid-Number/) (java)
Validate if a given string is numeric.

### [70. Climbing Stairs](./070. Climbing Stairs/) (python/java)
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

[073. Set Matrix Zeroes](./073. Set Matrix Zeroes/)(java)
Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.
